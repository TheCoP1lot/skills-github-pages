Like anything in life you have to learn to crawl before you walk. But some of us stand up and run, and others do not. 
Some of us make a bee-line for the finish and some of us take a long winding scenic route there, because we aren't worried about trophies and gold stars.
I personally am not a fan of other people's opinions of me, I know I'm a lot. I don't need to hear you whining about it. 
If you don't like the way I was created , take your complaint to God.
